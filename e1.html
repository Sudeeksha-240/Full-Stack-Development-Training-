            <h2>Brief History of Modern India</h2>
            <br>
            <blockquote>
            Modern India, generally considered to span from the mid-18th century to the present, is characterized by the decline of the Mughal empire,
            the rise of British colonial rule, the Indian independence movement, and the subsequent establishment of a parliamentary democracy. 
            This period includes significant social, economic, and political transformations shaped by both internal dynamics and external influences.
            <aside style="background-color: mediumturquoise;">
            Decline of the Mughal Empire:
            The weakening Mughal rule created a power vacuum that allowed European trading companies, particularly the British East India Company,
             to establish their dominance.
